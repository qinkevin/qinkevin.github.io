# chapter 1
- For all its strengths,MapReduce is fundamentally a batch processing system,and is not suitable for interactive analysis,so it's best for offline use
- HBase provides both online read/write access of individual rows and batch operations for reading and writing data in bulk,making it a good solution for building applications on
- YARN is a cluster resource management system,which allows any distributed program(not just MapReduce) to run on data in a Hadoop cluster
- MapReduce is a good fit for problems that need to analyze the whole dataset in a batch fashion,particularly for ad hoc analysis.An RDBMS is good for point queries or updates,where the dataset has been indexed to deliver low-latency retrieval and  update times of a relatively small amount of data.MapReduce suits applications where the data is written once and read many times,whereas a relational database is good for datasets that are continually updated.
- Hadoop works well on unstructured or semi-structured data because it is designed to interpret the data at processing time (so called schema-on-read). This provides flexibility and avoids the costly data loading phase of an RDBMS, since in Hadoop it is just a file copy
