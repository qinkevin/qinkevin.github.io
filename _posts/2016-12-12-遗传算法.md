# 遗传算法
- Basic Ideas：Each solution to the problem is represented as a chromosome；The initial solutions may be randomly generated；Solutions are evolved during generations；Improved gradually based on the principle of natural evolution.
- Crossover：Exchange genetic materials between two chromosomes.
- Mutation:Randomly modify gene values at selected locations.
- 是并行搜索所以达到全局最优
- Mutation is mainly used to maintain the genetic diversity
- Selection：Bias the search effort towards promising individuals；Loss of genetic diversity
- Crossover：Create better individuals by combining genes from good individuals；Building Block Hypothesis；Major search power of GAs；No effect on  genetic diversity
- Mutation：Increase genetic diversity；Force the algorithm to search areas other than the current focus.
- GA Framework
