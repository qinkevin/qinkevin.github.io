# 二叉树期权定价模型
- Writing a call option means that you are selling a call option
- option pricing theory applies to a very general class of economic problems — the valuation of contracts where the outcome to each party depends on a quantifiable uncertain future event
- Riskless portfolios must,in the absence of arbitrage opportunities,earn the risk-free rate of interest。
- 一种方式是首先计算使得投资组合无风险的每份期权对应的股票数，即使得上升和下降的收益是相同的；然后为了使得无套利机会，必须使得无风险的投资组合只赚取无风险利率。
- 二叉树模型期权定价公式并没有涉及到上升和下降的概率，the key reason is that we are not valuing the option in absolute terms.we are calculating its value in terms of the price of the underlying stock.The probabilities of future up or down movements are already incorporated into the stock price: we do not need to take them into account again when valuing the option in terms of the stock price.
- 另一种方式是利用期权现在的价格是它的期望值的折现值，上升和下降的概率可使用股票的现值等于期望的折现值计算
- risk-neutral valuation: The resulting prices are correct not just in a risk-neutral world,but in other worlds as well
- 美式期权的定价：the procedure is to work back through the tree from the end to the beginning,testing at each node to see whether early exercise is optimal.The value of the option at the final nodes is the same as for the European option.
- The delta of a stock option, considers the effect of a small change in the underlying stock price on the change in the option price.For a risk less position,  an investor should buy delta shares for each option sold.An inspection of a typical binomial tree shows that delta changes during the life of an option.This means that to hedge a particular option position,  we must change our holding in the underlying stock periodically.
