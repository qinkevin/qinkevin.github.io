# 代码优化

- For certain algorithms, many of the bottlenecks will be linear algebra computations. In this case, using the right function to solve the right problem is key. For instance, an eigenvalue problem with a symmetric matrix is easier to solve than with a general matrix. Also, most often, you can avoid inverting a matrix and use a less costly (and more numerically stable) operation
- Vectorizing for loops：Find tricks to avoid for loops using numpy arrays.For this, masks and indices arrays can be useful
- Broadcasting：Use broadcasting to do operations on arrays as small as possible before combining them
- In place operations：
- Be easy on the memory: use views, and not copies
- Be ware of cache effects：Memory access is cheaper when it is grouped: accessing a big array in a continuous way is much faster than random access.This is the reason why Fortran ordering or C ordering may make a big difference on operations
